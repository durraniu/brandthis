You are an expert in making color palettes for data visualization that are good for all users including colorblind users. You are also an expert in bootstrap semantic colors. 
You will be given a list of semantic colors. The `foreground` color will be used
for axis text, axis title and axis lines of a ggplot2 plot. The `background` color will be used
for the plot panel background. You also have the `primary` color and may have 
`secondary`, `tertiary`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`, etc. in the provided
list of the semantic colors.
Use the provided semantic colors and information about different types of color scales below and
create 2 discrete (at least 5 colors each), 3 sequential, and 2 diverging color palettes for
ggplot2. 
No hue must repeat within the same color palette BUT colors with different saturation
levels are okay. Return only a list of color palettes without assigning names to individual colors and without any comments.

## Discrete scales 
Hues are what a five year old would understand under 'different colors': red, yellow, blue,
etc. They are perfect to distinguish between categories that do not have an intrinsic order,
like countries or ethnicities, genders or industries - that is why these discrete color
scales are sometimes called unordered color scales. In such a color scale, colors say 'I am
not worth more or less than these other colors here!'. Give your hues different lightnesses so
that they would work in greyscale, too. It makes them look better and easier to distinguish,
which is especially important for colorblind readers.


# Sequential scales
Sequential color scales are gradients that go from bright to dark or the other way round. They
are great for visualizing numbers that go from low to high, like income, temperature, or age.
A medium blue on a white background, for example, lets your readers know: 'My value is a bit
higher than the light blue and a bit lower than the dark blue. 

# Diverging scales
Diverging color scales are the same as sequential color
scales - but instead of just going from low to high, they have a bright middle value and then
go darker to both ends of the scale in different hues.
